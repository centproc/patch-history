><strong><h2>Adjustment Summary</h2></strong>
<p>
With this update we've added some balance adjustments to a few characters. These were made with the following objectives in mind.

1. Improve characters that could not fully express their individual potential.
2. Improve techniques that were clearly difficult to use.
3. Weaken elements that controlled an opponent's action too severely.
</p>

><strong><h4>1. Improve characters that could not fully express their individual potential.</h4></strong>
<p>
Most of these adjustments focused on Jamie and Ryu.

Jamie is a character whose potential improves the higher his drink level gets, but there was a lot of work required to unlock that potential, and it was difficult for him to show what he was capable of. For this update, we looked to alleviate this issue by increasing the number of ways he can increase his drink level.

While Ryu looks like a character that has been carefully balanced when viewed in a vacuum, he has very few elements to his gameplan that stick out, and in the "standard character" category, his individuality is a bit thin. To address this point, we've made adjustments so that it's easier to make use of his Hadoken, and increased the number of ways players can incorporate his Hashogeki into their gameplan.
</p>

><strong><h4>2. Improve techniques that were clearly difficult to use.</h4></strong>
<p>
We've improved techniques that were difficult to connect with in combos or were unreliable as anti-air techniques.
</p>

><strong><h4>3. Weaken elements that controlled an opponent's action too severely.</h4></strong>
<p>
We primarily looked at techniques that were very strong as defensive measures for characters. We felt that in the neutral and while on defense, there were some techniques that were low risk but yielded a high return. Therefore we've weakened those techniques that controlled an opponent's action too severely.

Regarding Ken's throw, while this is an offensive attack, he winds up in an ideal situation no matter where he is, which creates too much pressure, particularly for characters that don't have any invincible attacks. In order to alleviate this situation, when his throw lands in the corner of the screen, we've made it so that he is in a slightly worse situation after the throw.

We feel that the adjustments made during this update cover more area than previous battle adjustments, but we looked to even out the balance of the game without changing anything dramatically. This means that there are some characters that have absolutely no changes, and some characters that were only weakened, but we are looking at performing an overall balance adjustment in the future that will also affect characters not touched with this update. We appreciate your patience as we work towards that.

><strong><h2>Universal</h2></strong>

><strong><h4>Modern Controls</h4></strong>
<p>
Fixed an issue where if a player using Modern Controls would perform a special move using the SP button, scaling would not be applied to that special move if its activation overlapped with screen darkening from an opponent's Drive Rush.
</p>

><strong><h4>Modern and Dynamic Controls</h4></strong>
<p>
Added an option to allow for normal throws to be mapped to its own button under Control Settings.
Please note that it will be automatically assigned to the LT Button as a default setting.
</p>

><strong><h4>Armor</h4></strong>
<p>
Fixed an issue where when an attack with super armor properties, like a Drive Impact, etc., is in the middle of a hit stop due to absorbing an attack, an attack with Armor Break properties would not cause an armor break in that situation.
</p>

><strong><h4>Drive Rush</h4></strong>
<p>
Fixed an issue where if both players performed a Drive Rush at the same time, one player's movement would be 1 frame slower.
</p>

><strong><h4>Perfect Parry</h4></strong>
<p>
Fixed an issue where under specific conditions, a Perfect Parry would occur even though the Drive Parry absorbed the attack after the 3rd frame of its start up.
</p>

><strong><h4>Input Buffering</h4></strong>
<p>
Fixed an issue with the input buffer, as the input buffer time for a reversal after blocking an attack should change depending on the block's recovery, but for Drive Reversals and some other attacks, it was not properly set.
